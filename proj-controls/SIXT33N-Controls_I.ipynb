    "In this phase we will first build the SIXT33N chassis and the sensors (wheel encoders) and actuators (motor drivers). We will also power the car up using a 9V battery, and power the Launchpad with another 9V. Next, we will model the the car as an open loop system. We will gather some dynamics data to figure out the variables in our model and lastly build a closed loop controller. By the end of the phase, you should be able to control the trajectory of the car, which will be integrated with the other components of the project in the last phase.\n",

    "## Battery and Voltage Regulator\n",
    "\n",
    "You probably do not want to try to power SIXT33N off your laptop and run around with a long cord chasing it. Thus, <b>you will run the car off of two 9V batteries</b>. You will use one of the batteries exclusively for the motors, and the other for powering the Launchpad and microphone front end. The reason for this is that the motors consume a lot of current, but the current is not constant - in fact, it is very noisy. If we were to use the same voltage source for the Launchpad and the motors, the Launchpad would restart everytime the motors pulled too much current. Note that the ground is still all connected (i.e. the grounds of the two batteries are connected). The whole power distribution is shown in the diagram below. The front end circuit will use both the regulator output and the Launchpad's 3.3V pin.\n",

    "The Launchpad and the front end circuit needs a 5V source so you need to add a voltage regulator circuit. The <a href=\"http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm7805.pdf\">LM340T5</a> is a voltage regulator that outputs around 5V. Glance through the datasheet (figure 6) to find the pin diagram. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to build this small circuit on your breadboard - the same one you built your Front End circuit on last week. <b>First, connect the input $V_{in}$ to 9V from the bench power source</b>. Don't forget to connect the ground of the regulator to the rail you want to be ground. Add 2 $10 \\mu F$ capacitors as in the schematic below. These will help decrease noise even further.\n",

    "**<span style=\"color:red\">Use your multimeter to check that the output of your regulator is 5V.</span>**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we want to use a 9V battery instead of the bench power source. To make it easier and safer to turn the battery on and off, we will add a switch. First, take the power supply off the voltage regulator. <b>Never connect both the power source and the battery at the same time. Don't do it.</b> Use the middle pin of the switch and one of the edge pins to connect the 9V battery lead to the voltage regulator input. The opposite edge pin should remain unconnected. The ground of the 9V battery lead should go to the ground rail of the circuit. Also, remember, that your battery leads should have a knot in them (see the image below). Please be sure to put a knot in your battery leads. Tie the red and black wires in a simple square knot as shown below. This will drastically decrease the chance that the leads will accidentlly short and kill your battery. We don't want any dead batteries.\n",

If you leave it running it will only last a little over an hour. If the voltage of the battery drops below 7.8V, ask for a new one from your GSI.\n",

    "## Motor Drivers\n",
    "To be able to move, the car needs motor drivers. The DC motors we use are usually driven by a Pulse Width Modulated (PWM) signal which will be produced by the Launchpad. A PWM signal is simply a square wave at a certain frequency but with variable duty cycle (percentage time the signal is high in a period). Since the motors need a lot of power, as mentioned before, we will connect the motors to their own separate 9V battery and use an NPN transistor control whether the motor is powered or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The NPN BJT behaves a little different from the NMOS you are familiar with, but both transistors can still be considered as switch-like. An NMOS uses voltage to control whether the switch is off or on, but a BJT uses current to control the switch. When the Launchpad outputs a 0V, there is no current flowing into the base (BJT equvalent of gate) so the BJT does not allow current to flow through the motor. When the Launchpad outputs a logical high (3.3V), current is allowed to flow through the base and turn the motor on. However, BJTs can be burned by running too much current through them, so a $2K\\Omega$ resistor is used to limit the current. \n",

    "A diode is a component that only conducts current one way. If the voltage in the anode is higher than the cathode (see diagram below), it will conduct current from the anode to the cathode and behave somewhat like a closed switch. However, if the voltage in the anode is lower than the cathode, it does not conduct current and behaves like an open switch. This diode is needed because of the inductive behavior of the motor. A DC motor is made using a coil of wire, just like an iductor. When we initially place a voltage across this coil, a current will flow. If we do not add this diode, we risk harming the BJT. The diagram for the diode is shown below. Note that the diode has a direction - be careful which terminal is attached to the 9V power supply.\n",

    "Before trying to control the SIXT33N, we will first characterize the open loop reponse of the system. To make modeling easier, we will separate the two wheels' model. The model that we create for both wheels can be identical because they are symmetric, but will have different parameters to account for subtle differences in the hardware. The distance that each wheel has moved (measured in number of encoder ticks) at sample $k$ will be denoted using $d_L[k]$ and $d_R[k]$ for the left and right wheels respectively.

The sampling period is $T_s = 200$ms. Power the Launchpad from the voltage regulator using the 5V pin (don't forget to ground it as well!). Place the car in a large empty space and hit the reset button. After a couple seconds it will start moving and a couple seconds after that it starts collecting data. Since the motors and wheels aren't the highest quality, the car will probably turn in a circle even when the same PWM is applied to both wheels.

Try tuning your gains and simulating the model to observe its performance. Now try it with slightly wrong estimates for the parameters $\\theta$ and $\\beta$. Because of the feedback, your closed-loop controller should make both wheels drive at the same velocity even if the parameters are a bit off. Choose values $k_L$ and $k_R$, then fill in the two functions below. Run the similation in the second block to see how different parameters affect the system."
